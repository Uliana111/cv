## About Myself:
I am a first year university student. Before entering, I was not interested in programming, but when I started studying, I decided to develop in this field of activity. Because of the desire to start understanding this, I decided to take individual courses in programming and coding. From the very beginning of the training, I began to have difficulties with understanding the educational material, but this topic was already of interest to me. Then I started to understand the basics. In the first half of the year we worked on editors Inkscape, Adobe Photoshop and Download Blender.

Since I had to learn French at school, I learned English on my own in my spare time. Now I attend foreign language courses, I study English in a group. At the university, we are taught professional vocabulary of the English language. Now I understand that I want to develop in the field of programming and work in my specialty. This is my first cv and my first project. However, I am going to develop my level of English and programming further.
